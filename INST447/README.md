Our final project for this class involved us determining if there was a relationship between the income of a neighborhood and the amount of redvelopment that happens in that neighborhood. The area we studied was D.C. We obtained our redevelopment data from opendata.dc.gov and our income data from planning.dc.gov. The full project can be found in the jupyter notebook file (GroupProjectNotebook.ipynb). A list and link to all the data used can be found in the Sources of files.docx file. My role in the project was to do the cleaning and processing, while my partner worked on the visualizations or graphs.
